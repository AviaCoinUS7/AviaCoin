First, our new digital token AviaCoin US7 isn't simply a new digital token, one of hundreds or even thousand others.
Our new digital token, AviaCoin US7 is a principally new generation of digital tokens, with its philosophy of the development and 
its vision of the future practical usage by the Int'l Companies, private (local) customers, or even well-developed Government structures & 
Banks. 
The background of our new digital token, AviaCoin US7, comes from the XXth century when German businessman Dr. Silvio 
Geyser created a new type of money, called later “geyser money.” Such money appeared in Germany in the 30s, Austria, then even in 
America. And this money helped bring certain regions (across the World) out of the Great Depression of the 30s. 
This geyser money, of course, has a velocity of circulation much higher than regular fiat (legitimate) money. That is, it is money 
with adverse interest. That is, money is not intended to fulfill the function of preserving wealth; it is money that has a single part - a means 
of fast circulation and a means of wide exchange. Of course, t velocity guard.
